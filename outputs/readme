This directory contains all raw output files. Here are the description of each directory:

--------------------------------------- FBA_photon ---------------------------------------
Contains 16 files that were run for 8 different biomass compositions and with photon uptake varying as follows:
  70-82DAP named as C1-C2 files
WR1	Photon_tx = 0.0096
WR2	Photon_tx = 0.0346
WR3	Photon_tx = 0.0480
WR4	Photon_tx = 0.0590
  82-97DAP named as C2-C3 files
WR1	Photon_tx = 0.0636
WR2	Photon_tx = 0.1248
WR3	Photon_tx = 0.1576
WR4	Photon_tx = 0.1256
The files _toSampl exhibit the constrains used in the Random Sampling approach.

--------------------------------------- FBA_photon0 ---------------------------------------
Contains 16 files that were run for 8 different biomass compositions without photon uptake (Photon_0_).
Similarly, 70-82DAP condition was named as C1-C2 files, and 82-97DAP named as C2-C3 files.
The files _toSampl exhibit the constrains used in the Random Sampling approach.

--------------------------------------- FBA_best_photon ---------------------------------------
Contains 48 files that were run for 8 different biomass compositions.
Six different photon uptake were used for each biomass:
70-82DAP named as C1-C2 files
WR1	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
WR2	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
WR3	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
WR4	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
 82-97DAP named as C2-C3 files
WR1	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
WR2	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
WR3	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20
WR4	Photon_tx = 0.0125  /  = 0.025  /  = 0.05  /  = 0.10  /  = 0.15  /  = 0.20

--------------------------------------- FBA_calvin---------------------------------------
Contains 120 files that were run for 8 different biomass compositions.
Fifteen different photon uptake were used for each biomass:
