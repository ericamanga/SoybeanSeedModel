This directory contains data files used to run FBA of SoybeanSeedModel.
Here are the description of each directory:

--------------------------------------- mat ---------------------------------------
Contains 16 files as *.mat format, thus they can be opened into MATLAB directly.

--------------------------------------- photon0_mean_median ---------------------------------------
Contains 56 files that were run for NADPH, NADH, and ATP for every 8 different biomass compositions.
There was no photon uptake (Photon0).
The 70-82DAP condition was named as C1-C2 files, and 82-97DAP named as C2-C3 files.
The files _toSampl exhibit the outputs file ran with the Random Sampling approach.

--------------------------------------- photon_mean_median ---------------------------------------

There was photon uptake.
The 70-82DAP condition was named as C1-C2 files, and 82-97DAP named as C2-C3 files.
The files _toSampl exhibit the outputs file ran with the Random Sampling analysis.

--------------------------------------- results_perCarbon ---------------------------------------
Contains 16 files, 8 with and 8 without photon uptake, where it was calculated,
from Random Sampling analysis, each flux per Carbon uptaken 
were used as either as input or as output to run FBA.
The format files are .xml, .yml, or .csv.

--------------------------------------- templateModels ---------------------------------------
Contains 6 files that were used as either input or output to run FBA.
The format files are .xml, .yml, or .csv.
